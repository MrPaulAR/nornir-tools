Configuration Management
========================

This is a simple example to show how you can write a runbook to deploy some configuration. The code is commented so feel free to take a peak and try to understand what's going on.

You should be able to use the `Vagrantfile` in the `inventory` and run the command `./configure.py`.

Feel free to change `dry_run=True` to `dry_run=False` to change the configuration, to play with the `nr.filter` or the templates or do whatever other experiments you may want to try out.
